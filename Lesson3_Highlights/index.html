            <p class="lead">Version control is a repository system which records all changes that have been made to a project. The system works for any kind of project including documentation, design or development that benefit from backing up and reverting to previous statuses.
            </p>
          
             <p class="lead"> The version control functions save and a lot of time, and energy by giving the ‘undo’ options in the process of development. Version control system notes who changes the file when the changes occurred, and what the change is.
            </p>
            <h2 class= "text-muted"> VCS's Evolution</h2>
            <p class="lead">  Version control programs have evolved through time. Initially, Local Version Control Systems (LVCS) was developed. These were simple databases system that copies all changes made to files, and then recreate the files as it was on a specified date. 
            </p>
             <p class="lead">  Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) were developed to respond to the need for being able to collaborate on a single project. These programs placed their different versioned files in a centralized database and allow different programmers to check out the files. Although this system is an excellent tool for administration, it has a single point failure as a major drawback. When the server is down, all people working on the database will be unable to save their work. 
             </p>
             <p class="lead">  Distribution Version Control System (DVCS)addressed the issue of single point of failure in CVCS. This system lets clients check out files with their full backup history. If the master file in the repository is damaged for some reason, the checkout files could be used to replace it. This makes distributed version control systems more powerful than both local and centralized version control systems.

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) developed by Linux development community in 2005 having the goals of speed, simplicity, strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed and ability to handle large projects. Git differs from other version control systems in a way it sees data. Other systems see data as files and record the change made to those files over time. Gits take a snapshot of each version and save or stores them only when there is a change or a difference. It considers its data like a streamline of snapshots. Git has some more benefits over the other systems
            </p>
            <h2 class= "text-muted"> Git Benefits</h2>
            <p class="lead"> <strong> Local Operation: </strong>local computers usually have all the necessary files and resources required to run Git. It is possible to work and commit offline and push later on when a connection is available. 

            </p>
            <p class="lead"> <strong> Integrity:</strong> Git will detect when a change was made to a content or when files get corrupted in the transition process. 

            </p>
            <p class="lead"> <strong> Only add data:</strong> Git generally only add data to a database and it is always possible to undo, which facilitates room for experimentation.

            </p>
            <p class="lead"> <strong> Three states: </strong>  Git files has three states 
                <ol class ="lead"> 
                    <li> committed: when the data is stored in the database. </li>
                    <li> modified: when a change has been made to a file but not yet stored in the database  </li>
                    <li> staged: when the modified files are marked to be committed</li>
            </ol>   
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> The three status of files in a repository dictates Git workflow which is modified, add and commit.

            <p class="lead">Having a basic understanding of command lines (navigation and changing file system) helps to have a good grip of Git commands and work in a Git repository. There are two ways to get a Git repositor 
                <ol class= "lead">
                    <li> Turning local directory to Git repository </li>
                    <li> Cloning an existing repository from somewhere </li>
                 </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> When working in the existing Git repository, initializing the Git is the first step. The git command for doing so is git init and it should be run inside the working directory. This command creates a folder inside the working directory and placed all necessary files.

            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Running git Clone copies an existing Git repository i.e. every version of every file in the history will be cloned. Git Clone command has an argument that specifies which directory to clone and we give name of our target directory 
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> There are two kinds of files in our working directory: tracked and untracked. Tracked files are the ones that are modified, staged or committed and as a result, included in the latest version of Gits snapshot. Untracked files are those files, which are not included in the latest snapshot. When untracked files are modified, Git notes the change and record their snapshot.

            </h2>
             
            <p class="lead">Here are some of the basic Git commands that we use in Git’s workflow which involves modifying, staging and committing files to a Git Repository.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Checking a Status: <mark>git status </mark> is used to check the status of files. This command checks whether there are untracked files and display the list. It also shows on which branch we are currently on <mark> .git status -s </mark> or <mark> git status –short</mark> gives a simplified result. Git status list out the just name of files that are modified, however, <mark> git diff </mark> gives a much more detailed account of the change in the file.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Tracking New files: <mark>git add </mark>  is used to look for new files that are not tracked. This command put the files in the staging area, where they will be ready to be stored in the repository. This command takes the name of the file or directory that is to be tracked. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Modified File: <mark> git add </mark> is also used when we want to stage modified files. These files have been tracked or added before, but their new status is not captured until we run git add. this command helps them be captured in their latest version. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Committing Changes: <mark> git commit </mark> is the command used to finally store the file to a repository. It will store all the files that are staged not necessarily modified. We use <mark>git rm </mark> and <mark> git mv</mark> to remove and move riles respectively

            <p class="lead">Git hub is a largest remote host for Git Repositories. It helps millions of developers to collaborate on projects. It is also used to host many open-source projects.  Any interested developer can sign up for GitHub account and use the repository. GitHub can easily be linked to development environment such as Cloud 9.  Here are the steps involved in linking cloud 9 to GitHub.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 1. The first step is to create GitHub account by going to https://github.com. Creating account is free but payment is required if a private repository is chosen.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 2. Linking to cloud 9 account: we achieve this by logging in to cloud 9 account. Under the account setting, there is list of connection services and GitHub is selected to connect.  On the same page, click SSH Keys section and copy the relevant key and adding it to GitHub account. 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 3. Configure a GitHub in Cloud 9. This can be done by login to cloud 9 account through the GitHub icon and adding to username and password inside the bash terminal.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 4. Move files to local depository using Git commands git init and git add and git commit
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 5. Create a new repository inside GitHub account 
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Step 6. Lastly, push the files to the newly created remote repository and verify by refreshing the GitHib account.
